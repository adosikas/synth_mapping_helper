# Example Scripts (For advanced users)

This directory will contain examples on how call this module from python to do various tasks.

You can download them individually and place them anywhere as long as this module is installed correctly.

To run a script, open a terminal and enter `python3 <script_name>.py <arguments>`, or double-click them if python is setup to run scripts (you might not see errors that way tho).

The code of the scripts may contain further instructions or configuration options.
